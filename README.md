# pytchie
Random music synthesis in Python. Still a work in progress.

*This was made in about three days as a project for a computer music class. While I hope to do some cleanup and revision in the future, it is currently quite possibly some of the worst code I've ever written. Forker beware.*

### How to use

To generate your own music, [download the Windows executable](https://github.com/jeremycryan/pytchie/blob/master/win_executable.zip?raw=true), extract it, and run music_gen_gui.exe.
